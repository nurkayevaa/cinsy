The program is also helping the City save money long-term while improving customer service delivery and enhancing public safety in the process.In Year Two (Fiscal Year 2017) of the program, CAP funded 54 police Ford Interceptors along with 54 other vehicles ranging from snow plows, pick-up trucks and utility vans.  When combined with the traditional Capital Improvement Program (CIP), the City of Cincinnati has replaced 329 vehicles over the last two years. That includes six recently received fire trucks and five street sweepers.Mayor John Cranley, City Manager Harry Black and representatives from the Department of Public Services (DPS) displayed some of the new vehicles at the DPS Administration Building Thursday, many of which are already in use.WATCH THE PRESS CONFERENCE BELOWVIEW PHOTOS FROM EVENT“Beyond the money we’re saving tax payers, this is really about giving police and fire the resources to do their jobs,” said Mayor Cranley. “The quality of our vehicles and equipment directly impacts the ability of first responders to keep the City safe.”CAP investment in Fleet services utilizes Capital Fund resources to enable the City to make investments in vehicles and equipment that use less gas, require less maintenance, and will need fewer repairs. This not only cuts costs but also keeps vehicles on the road and improves the environment.“What we’re doing through this program is investing not just in pieces of vehicles and equipment, but in our City by ensuring our staff is able to deliver the highest level of customer service possible,” added City Manager Black.In addition to the CAP program, the as part of the Clean Cincinnati effort the City has purchased 5 new street sweepers and 4 dump trucks to support a revamped street neighborhood street sweeping program. The initiative will mean every City street gets swept on a monthly basis.Approximately 60 percent of the City’s Fleet was out of life cycle prior to CAP. Through CAP the City will spend approximately $40 million of additional funding over a 12-year period to replace all City-owned vehicles. That includes replacing approximately 250 Police Department vehicles within the first five years.The City is spending 39 percent of those funds during the first two years of the program in order to replace mission critical equipment as soon as possible.“DPS is proud of this investment and the long-term financial benefit it will have on the City of Cincinnati. We’d like to thank Mayor Cranley, City Council and City Manager Black for their support of this program,” said DPS Dir. Maraskeshia Smith.Beyond Fleet, CAP invests in City streets by providing millions of dollars in additional funding for improvements over the next six years. Combined with the annual street improvement program, outside grants and CAP, Cincinnati is investing approximately $172 million to rehabilitate or resurface more than half its 2,936 total lane miles in all 52 neighborhoods by June 30, 2021.More information about the CAP can be found on the City of Cincinnati’s website by visiting theprogram website.WATCH THE PRESS CONFERENCE CAP Puts 54 Police SUVs, Other New Vehicles on City StreetsProgram enhances safety, customer service and saves moneyCINCINNATI – There are 54 new police vehicles on Cincinnati streets as a result of the Capital Acceleration Plan (CAP), an innovative financing initiative that is bringing the City’s old and severely deteriorated fleet of vehicles into lifecycle.

A clean street keeps storm drains clear of debris, helps prevent localized street flooding due to clogged catch basins, and prevents pollutants from reaching the waterways.  Street sweeping works best when the sweepers can sweep from curb to curb. Basketball hoops, garbage cans, vehicles, and trailers left in the street prevent the sweeper from hugging the curb and performing the most effective sweeping possible.DPS’ sweeping program consists of five street sweepers and five dirt trucks, sweeping City streets once per month on static routes. The sweepers simultaneously mist the street, while rotating brooms sweep debris and dust into the hopper (unit). When the hopper is full, the contents are transferred to a dirt truck to be taken to a landfill.Scheduled routes are subject to changes due to weather, staffing, and equipment.Here are some ways for residents to remember their street-sweeping days:Click on thisLINKand enter a property address.Download the free‘311Cincy’mobile app, available on Apple and Android devices.

This equipment is deployed using weather predictions provided by local television networks and a variety of local and national weather forecasting services.How does the City develop a winter operations plan?The City assesses road conditions from local forecasts, weather websites and professional weather services to form an operations plan for each storm. Every snow storm is different, and the planning for each storm takes many factors into account, including snow accumulation predictions and temperatures before, during, and immediately after the end of the snowfall. These factors drive the planning process.How will you keep the public informed about street conditions?The Department of Public Services utilizes every means possible to improve communications to better inform the public.  As always, the City partners with the news media to keep citizens informed. You can also receive updates through:FacebookTwitterNextdoorHow can I help the City with its snow removal plan?Please, exercise extreme caution when snowfall begins. You can also help by shoveling your sidewalk and limiting travel as much as possible during extreme winter snow events.Who is responsible for clearing sidewalks?Ohio Revised Code 723.011 authorizes the City of Cincinnati to require property owners to remove snow and ice from abutting or adjoining sidewalks in a timely manner. Additional information is available in theSnow Removal and Ice Control Plan.Please be a Good Neighbor: Do your part to help our residents – especially our elderly neighbors and our neighbors with disabilities – navigate through the difficulties of winter.If my car gets towed because of a snow emergency, how do I get it back?If a snow emergency is declared, citizens are given adequate time to move their cars from posted snow emergency routes before any tickets are issued or vehicles towed. For information about where your vehicle was towed, please contact the Cincinnati Police District Office that patrols the location where your car was parked. You will be responsible for the costs of any violations.What methods does the City use to treat ice- or snow-covered streets?The City uses three treatment methods when addressing snow accumulation:Anti-icing is a pre-treatment product (salt or salt brine) used on the streets to prevent snow or ice from binding to roadways.De-icing occurs by using calcium chloride and salt on streets during the storm to melt snow or ice precipitation.Plowing uses snow equipment to remove higher accumulations of snow before using de-icing products. Plowing may leave rows or ridges of snow in front of driveways and is the slowest treatment process.My street has been treated, but it is still not passable without a lot of difficulty.  What should I do?Several elements increase the melting action of the salt, including sun, heat from your vehicle's tires and time. The process is actually helped by traffic moving carefully on the street.  Use your winter driving skills to maneuver on streets that are treated and the salt will do its job. Allow extra time and drive carefully.When do you plow the streets to make them passable?There is a flexible standard of plowing streets when snow accumulation reaches four (4) inches and additional accumulation is expected.  There are other factors to consider before we include plowing in our snow removal plan, such as temperatures before, during and right after the snowfall -- as well as the amount of additional snowfall that is expected.  Plowing slows down our operation because the trucks must plow at 15 mph. Managers determine whether plowing will increase the efficiency of the overall operation for each snow event.
